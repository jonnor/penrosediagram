the raves of deception
a world in devestation
relevation is knocking on our door
the thought of genocide
it breaks me to pieces
execute the innocence
the fact we cannot ignore
I cant believe this is democracy
I cant believe this is reality
they will exterminate us
and depopulate us
we are just puppets - labeled "enemy"

[chorus]
our generation is divine
open your eyes and see
let our voices rise
let us belive

we are our own enemy
we need to face reality
as the sun fades away
let tomorrow be a brighter day

[verse]
its a system of corruption
a price will testify
that evolved into a sign
of global suicide
our restriction is their advantage
executive action thats taking our rights

we are divided
we are being haunted
its an invasion
of our extinsion

we are facing hunger and destruction
we need to come together
and change our direction

[chorus]

[bridge]
what do you want from me
what do you want from me
what do you want from me
go ahead and take it

[chorus]

[bridge]
