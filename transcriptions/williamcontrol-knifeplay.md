she wal the scars with perfect pale skin raised
now shes falilng in love and depraved
her body is bent in bruises and voice that praised

I've falled in love with a slave
I've falled in love with a slave

[Chorus]
she loves her knife play
yeah she's not alone
she loves her knife play
yeah she's not alone
not alone

she felt alive in a perfect world of sin
now shes fallen too all over her soul

she felt the blade pressed in
felt the cold steel win
her heartbeat controlled
shes fallen to all over her soul


she loves her knife play
and she's not alone
she loves her knife play
and she's not alone
she loves her knife play
yeah she's not alone
she loves her knife play
yeah she's not alone
shes not alone
shes not alone
shes not alone
