It is part of the evolution

Every step and every second
It follows a certain pattern
A step at a time
ALl the..

Some ..
in this world and universe


[chorus] x2
seconds turns to minutes
you close your eyes, and the hours pass
turning into days, and you don't know

what you did in the streets
that very moment in time
affected everyone around you
small step growing to a wonder
but you don't even know it

it is part of the evolution

[chorus]

shivers..
turning inside..
growing and growing..
tender stardust..
someday it will all stop
never ever regret
rows between the ages of live
ghost of everyone

million faces laughing at you now
and you don't notice

[chorus]

seconds turns to minutes
minutes turns to hours..
